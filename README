Overview of Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

Some Vine Reviews are paid by Amazon and others are unpaid. One of the objectives of the study is to see, if there is bias towards a 5 star rating by the paid reviewers.

Results:

How many Vine Reviews were there?
The dataset consists of over 1 million items (104,8575)
The total ratings are 65581.

How many Vine Reviews were 5 stars? 
5 Star Rating:222
Total Rating:613
Percentage of 5 star:36.21

How many non-vine reviews were 5 stars?
5 Star Rating:30453
Total Rating:64968
Percentage of 5 Star Rating:47.0123
What percentage of vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage  of non-vine reviews were 5 star 
Summary
The non-vine reviewers rated the product higher than the vine reviewers. So the Amazon reviewers (paid) were more stingy in their rating.

Another analysis to see bias can be a statistical analysis with box and whiskers plot. The median and the outliers would be different.
